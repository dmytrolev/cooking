<h2>Насіння Чіа</h2>

<p>Chia, (Salvia hispanica), also called Mexican chia or salba chia, species of
flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae), grown for its edible seeds. The
plant is native to Mexico and Guatemala, where it was an important crop for
pre-Columbian Aztecs and other Mesoamerican Indian cultures. Chia seeds are
touted for their health benefits, being high in fibre and omega-3 fatty acids,
and are now grown commercially in several countries, including Argentina,
Australia, Bolivia, Peru, and the United States.</p>

<p>Nutritionally, chia seeds are one of the most-concentrated sources of
alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are also high
in dietary fibre, protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, and antioxidants.
Although other seeds, such as flaxseeds, must be ground to enhance their
nutritional benefits, chia seeds are easily digested and thus can be eaten
whole. They are commonly sprinkled on salads, sandwiches, hot or cold cereals,
or yogurt and can be an ingredient of baked goods. The seeds can be mixed with
water, juice, or milk to form a thick beverage or pudding and can also be
sprouted and eaten fresh in salads and sandwiches. Given chia seeds’ high fibre
content and ability to expand as a gel, there is some evidence that they may
work as an appetite suppressant. They also show promise in reducing the risk of
heart disease, cancer, and stroke, though further studies are needed.</p>
