In Ukrainian cuisine, borsch is a national dish. Its numerous adaptations have
led to a plethora of forms. It may be a combination of many winter vegetables,
with meat and sour cream, or it may be as simple as beet kvas with meat stock
and shredded beets, garnished with mushroom dumplings, or just the broth from
beets, kvas, and stock with vushka. There are regional disputes as to the most
authentic form of borsch. This elegant version was popular in the Kievan region
in the 1830s.
