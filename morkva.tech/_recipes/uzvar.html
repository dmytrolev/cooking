The Ukraine is known for its beautiful and abundant orchards. Fruit
in many forms is eaten fresh and used cooked in dishes. Dried fruit
is used year round. This compote, a traditional dish made from dried
fruit, included dried legumes in olden times. In some regions, such
as Bukovyna, the combination of dried prunes and beans still lives
on. This recipe is a standard, widely used nineteenth~century version.
